Animate a Bouncing Ball
This project demonstrates the animation of a bouncing ball using the 12 Principles of Animation, focusing on:
Timing and Spacing to simulate changes in speed due to gravity and momentum
Squash and Stretch to make the motion more dynamic and believable
Arcs to follow natural movement paths
Graph Editor manipulation to fine-tune motion realism
Project Objectives
Apply the principles of timing and spacing to show speed changes representing gravity and momentum.
Use arcs, squash, and stretch to create a believable bounce for different types of balls.
Use the graph editor to adjust timing and spacing, enhancing the realism of the bounce.
Base the animation on real-world observations for accurate motion representation.
Tools Used Autodesk Maya
Graph Editor for curve manipulation
Output
The animation reflects the behavior of a ball bouncing under gravity, showcasing the influence of momentum and elasticity. Variants for different types of balls (rubber, basketball, bowling ball) may be included.
